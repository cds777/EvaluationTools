# EvaluationTools
Swift/Cocoa/CoreData OSX application to assist in mineral resource evaluations.

I am a newbie to object oriented programming and all the new development world.... Hello, world.

Today's difficulty is using Swift, Cocoa, and Core Data.  In xCode, I have defined the data entities and attributes, array controller, prepared the interface with add/remove buttons and a table to I/O the array, done all the bindings, etc, but when I run it I cannot add a record/instance.  It seems to expect an optional.  If I do the exact same thing in a new project, but select Objective-C instead of Swift, it works fine.  But at this early stage of the project, I would like to march down the Swift road rather than Objective-C.  Does anyone have a work-around?
